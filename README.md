# Wine-Quality-Regression-Analysis-
This repository contains a comprehensive regression analysis of the Wine Quality dataset, focusing on red wines. The dataset includes various chemical properties of wine and their corresponding quality ratings, which are used to predict the quality of wine using multiple regression models.The project covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), simple and multiple linear regression, and the application of advanced machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.

# Features:

# Data Overview:

* Detailed description of the dataset and its features.
* Summary statistics and data visualizations for initial insights.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Correlation analysis to understand the relationships between variables.
* Visualizations to explore distributions and relationships in the data.

# Regression Models:

* Implementation of simple and multiple linear regression models.
* Comparison of different regression techniques including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

# Model Evaluation:

* Performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to evaluate model accuracy.
* Visualizations of model predictions vs. actual values.

# Documentation and Reports:

* Detailed Jupyter Notebook documenting the entire analysis process.
* Summary report highlighting key findings and insights from the analysis.
* Multiple Linear Regression done on Excel.

# Usage:

This repository can be used as a reference for performing regression analysis on similar datasets. It provides a structured approach to data analysis, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. The code and methodologies used can be adapted for other regression tasks, making it a valuable resource for data science practitioners and enthusiasts.
